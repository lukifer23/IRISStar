## Optimizing Your Experience with Iris

The performance of Iris is directly influenced by the size, speed, and compute requirements of the models you use. These factors also impact the overall user experience. For a faster and smoother experience, consider downloading smaller models.

**Example Recommendation:**  
On opening the app, users can download suggested models to optimize performance based on their preferences and device capabilities.

---

#### Note:

- Smaller models are ideal for quicker interactions but may compromise slightly on response quality.
- Larger models offer more comprehensive responses but require higher compute power and may result in slower speeds.
- Choose a model that best balances speed and quality for your specific use case.

---

#### Disclaimer:

- Iris may produce **inaccurate results** depending on the complexity of queries and model limitations.
- Performance and accuracy are influenced by the size and type of model selected.
